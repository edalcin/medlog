# Tasks: MedLog - Sistema de Registro de Consultas M√©dicas

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-medlog-sistema-de/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not requested in feature specification - tests are optional and not included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js full-stack**: `app/` for pages/routes, `lib/` for utilities, `prisma/` for database, `components/` for UI

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript in repository root
- [x] T002 [P] Install core dependencies: Next.js, React, Prisma, Tailwind CSS
- [x] T003 [P] Install additional dependencies: authentication libraries, file upload utilities
- [x] T004 Create project structure per implementation plan (app/, components/, lib/, prisma/, etc.)
- [x] T005 Configure Tailwind CSS for styling
- [x] T006 Setup environment configuration (.env file and validation)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T007 Setup Prisma with MariaDB connection and schema definition
- [x] T008 [P] Implement Google OAuth authentication framework in lib/auth/
- [x] T009 [P] Create base User model and authentication utilities
- [x] T010 [P] Create Professional model with validation
- [x] T011 [P] Create Consultation model with relationships

- [ ] T014 Configure file upload handling and storage utilities
- [ ] T015 Setup error handling and response utilities

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - May use components from US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- API endpoints before UI components
- Core functionality before advanced features
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- API endpoints within a story can run in parallel
- UI components within a story can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch API endpoints together:
Task: "Implement GET /api/professionals endpoint"
Task: "Implement POST /api/consultations endpoint"
Task: "Implement POST /api/consultations/[id]/files endpoint"

# Launch UI components together:
Task: "Create consultation registration form component"
Task: "Create file upload component"
Task: "Create professional selection dropdown component"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test consultation creation independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (consultation registration)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (professional management)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (admin functions)
   - Developer D: User Story 3 (history viewing)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- File paths follow Next.js conventions
- Total tasks: 66 (Setup: 6, Foundational: 10, US1: 11, US2: 10, US4: 9, US3: 11, Polish: 9)
